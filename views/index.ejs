  <p id="indexP"> There are still explorers out there charting new lands and here they can share some of their discoveries with those looking for an Off the Map adventure. Here we can share destinations that are quit simply off trial. Places that require ingenuity and a sense of adventure to get to. It might be in a different country, your back yard, under a mountian but it's somehwere that's worth sharing wirh the world. Some areas you may have to hike, climb or swim to get to them but like all adventures you have to be the one reach it.

        In this section the adventurer will find out about locations that revolve around the water. 
        While most might be beaches hidden from the public, places where you can be by the ocean and 
        yet away from all the people. Or perhaps there is a ropeswing tied to an old sycamore tree that's 
        just around the river bend.

      Have you been needing to get out onto the trail?? These locations focus more on being in or around the forest and mountains. Areas that more often then not require a hike of some kind to get to them. These areas are more about the views or the 
      trail itself for people who need to get out of the city and into the fresh air.

      The final section will be exploring a different kind of area all together, that which is man made.
      The urban explorers guide to all things abandonded and forgoten. This is inclusive of all stuctures in and around the city; 
      bridges and airplane grave yards, from old factories to empty theme parks and all that falls bewteen. For those who are even more daring this is not limited to locations above the ground, but also below it..
